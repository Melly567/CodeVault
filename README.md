## About Me

Hello! I'm Melissa Onwuka, a Mechanical Engineering graduate who has transitioned into the exciting world of Data Science and Advanced Analytics. With a strong foundation in engineering principles, I am now exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Currently, my focus is on understanding and building **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **chatbots**.

## Areas of Interest
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and materials science.
- **Data Science**: Data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and deployment.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Large Language Models, chatbot creation, text analysis.

## What I'm Currently Learning
- Advanced machine learning techniques and architectures for LLMs
- Development and deployment of chatbots using LLMs
- Data science tools and libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers)
- Conversational AI and natural language understanding

## Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, MATLAB
- **Data Analysis**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling
- **Machine Learning & NLP**: Classification, regression, LLMs, chatbot development
- **Tools & Technologies**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Docker, SQL, Hugging Face Transformers

## Get in Touch

I'm eager to connect with others interested in AI, NLP, and chatbot development.
